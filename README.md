## ðŸ“¬ Contact Form Integration (Google Sheets)

I used **Google Apps Script** to connect my contact form with a Google Sheet, so all messages submitted from the form are directly stored in my sheet.

### Steps I followed:

1. Created a Google Sheet to store messages.
2. Opened **Apps Script Editor** in that sheet and added the script to handle POST requests.
3. Deployed it as a web app with "Anyone" access.
4. Used `fetch()` in JavaScript to send form data to that web app URL.

> This way, I donâ€™t need any server or backend code!
